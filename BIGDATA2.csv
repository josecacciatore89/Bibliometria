This has provided an impetus for organizations to adopt and perfect data analytic functions (e.g. data science, predictive analytics, and big data) in order to enhance supply chain processes and, ultimately, performance. However, management decisions informed by the use of these data analytic methods are only as good as the data on which they are based. In this paper, we introduce the data quality problem in the context of supply chain management (SCM) and propose methods for monitoring and controlling data quality. In addition to advocating for the importance of addressing data quality in supply chain research and practice, we also highlight interdisciplinary research topics based on complementary theory.","Benjamin T.

10.1016/j.ijpe.2016.08.018,,,How to improve firm performance using big data analytics capability and business strategy alignment,"The recent interest in big data has led many companies to develop big data analytics capability (BDAC) in order to enhance firm performance (FPER). However, BDAC pays off for some companies but not for others. It appears that very few have achieved a big impact through big data. To address this challenge, this study proposes a BDAC model drawing on the resource-based theory (RBT) and the entanglement view of sociomaterialism. The findings show BDAC as a hierarchical model, which consists of three primary dimensions (i.e., management, technology, and talent capability) and 11 subdimensions (i.e., planning, investment, coordination, control, connectivity, compatibility, modularity, technology management knowledge, technical knowledge, business knowledge and relational knowledge). The findings from two Delphi studies and 152 online surveys of business analysts in the U.S. confirm the value of the entanglement conceptualization of the higher-order BDAC model and its impact on FPER. The results also illuminate the significant moderating impact of analytics capability–business strategy alignment on the BDAC–FPER relationship.","Shahriar Akter,Shahriar Akter,Samuel Fosso Wamba,Samuel Fosso Wamba,Angappa Gunasekaran,Angappa Gunasekaran,Rameshwar Dubey,Rameshwar Dubey,Stephen J.

We first introduce the general background of big data and review related technologies, such as could computing, Internet of Things, data centers, and Hadoop. We then focus on the four phases of the value chain of big data, i.e., data generation, data acquisition, data storage, and data analysis. For each phase, we introduce the general background, discuss the technical challenges, and review the latest advances. We finally examine the several representative applications of big data, including enterprise management, Internet of Things, online social networks, medial applications, collective intelligence, and smart grid. These discussions aim to provide a comprehensive overview and big-picture to readers of this exciting area. This survey is concluded with a discussion of open problems and future directions.","Min Chen,Min Chen,Shiwen Mao,Shiwen Mao,Yunhao Liu,Yunhao Liu",Mobile Networks and Applications,2014
10.1016/j.ijpe.2016.03.014,,,Big data analytics in logistics and supply chain management: Certain investigations for research and applications,"The amount of data produced and communicated over the Internet is significantly increasing, thereby creating challenges for the organizations that would like to reap the benefits from analyzing this massive influx of big data. This is because big data can provide unique insights into, inter alia, market trends, customer buying patterns, and maintenance cycles, as well as into ways of lowering costs and enabling more targeted business decisions. Realizing the importance of big data business analytics (BDBA), we review and classify the literature on the application of BDBA on logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) – that we define as supply chain analytics (SCA), based on the nature of analytics (descriptive, predictive, prescriptive) and the focus of the LSCM (strategy and operations). To assess the extent to which SCA is applied within LSCM, we propose a maturity framework of SCA, based on four capability levels, that is, functional, process-based, collaborative, agile SCA, and sustainable SCA. We highlight the role of SCA in LSCM and denote the use of methodologies and techniques to collect, disseminate, analyze, and use big data driven information. Furthermore, we stress the need for managers to understand BDBA and SCA as strategic assets that should be integrated across business activities to enable integrated enterprise business analytics. Finally, we outline the limitations of our study and future research directions.","Gang Wang,Gang Wang,Gang Wang,Angappa Gunasekaran,Angappa Gunasekaran,Eric W.T. Ngai,Eric W.T.

Our study addresses two essential research questions: (1) How does organizational BDA usage affect value creation? and (2) What are key antecedents of organizational-level BDA usage? We draw on dynamic capabilities theory to conceptualize BDA use as a unique information processing capability that brings competitive advantage to organizations. Furthermore, we employ the technology–organization–environment (TOE) framework to identify and theorize paths via which factors influence the actual usage of BDA. Survey data collected from 161 U.S.-based companies show that: organizational-level BDA usage affects organizational value creation; the degree to which BDA usage influences such creation is moderated by environmental dynamism; technological factors directly influence organizational BDA usage; and organizational and environmental factors indirectly i...","Daniel Q.

However, there is confusion about what exactly data science is, and this confusion could lead to disillusionment as the concept diffuses into meaningless buzz. In this article, we argue that there are good reasons why it has been hard to pin down exactly what is data science. One reason is that data science is intricately intertwined with other important concepts also of growing importance, such as big data and data-driven decision making. Another reason is the natural tendency to associate what a practitioner does with the definition of the practitioner's field; this can result in overlooking the fundamentals of the field. We believe that trying to define the boundaries of data science precisely is not of the utmost importance.

We conduct an in-depth systematic review of IS literature on the topic and identify six debates central to how organizations realize value from big data, at different levels of analysis. Based on this review, we identify two socio-technical features of big data that influence value realization: portability and interconnectivity. We argue that, in practice, organizations need to continuously realign work practices, organizational models, and stakeholder interests in order to reap the benefits from big data. We synthesize the findings by means of an integrated model.","Wendy Günther,Wendy Arianne Günther,Mohammad Hosein Rezazade Mehrizi,Mohammad Hosein Rezazade Mehrizi,Marleen Huysman,Marleen Huysman,Frans Feldberg,Frans Feldberg",Journal of Strategic Information Systems,2017

This paper makes three contributions to the Special Issue's theme of enhancing organizational resource management. One is to establish an archetype business process for big data initiatives. The second contribution directs attention to creating a dynamic capability with big data initiatives. The third identifies drawbacks of resource based theory (RBT) and it's underpinning assumptions in the context of big data.

,,,Big Data and Predictive Business Analytics,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY | Today, the amount of data we are able to collect has been exploding. As a result, Big Data have become a new buzzword in information technology. Storing, managing, and analyzing Big Data is challenging, and will soon become a major differentiator between high-performing and low-performing organizations. This article discusses the issue of Big Data including the four dimensions of Big Data and the opportunities and challenges created by them. It also discusses various Big Data analytics applications.Every day, we use several different devices to generate large amounts of data; for example, searching online, making purchases through e-commerce web sites, making transactions in the supermarket, reading data from sensors, using social media to interact with our friends, and using GPS. All the data are accumulated and stored somewhere, which we call ""Big Data. ""WHAT IS BIG DATA?According to the McKinsey Global Institute, ""Big Data refer to datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage and analyze. ""The EdTech Report to the nation in 2013 states ""Every day, we create 2.5 quintillion (1020) bytes of data- so much that 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone. These data come from everywhere: sensors used to gather climate information, posts to social media sites, digital pictures and videos, purchase transaction records, and cell phone GPS signals to name a few. These data are ""Big Data."" The concept of Big Data actually is not new. We have been accumulating data since the beginning of recorded time. However, as technology advances, data are accumulating at an alarming rate.FOUR DIMENSIONS OF BIG DATAIBM data scientists break Big Data down into four dimensions: volume, velocity, variety, and veracity (4-Vs). The volume dimension refers to the scale of the data. From the beginning of recorded time until 2003, we created 5 billion gigabytes (exabytes) of data. In 2011, the same amount were created nearly every two days. In 2013, the same amount of data were created every 10 minutes. Velocity refers to the analysis of streaming data. As data are accumulated every second, data quickly become out-of-date. Therefore, it is important to use the data as fast as possible. The third dimension, variety, refers to different types of data we collect, e.g., structured data, unstructured data, text data, numerical data, image data, and audio and video data. Veracity refers to the uncertainty in the data.The data we collect may contain noise, but we do not know which data are accurate and which have noise. This is why many business leaders do not trust the information generated from them. What's more, according to IBM, poor data quality costs the U.S. economy around $3.1 trillion each year.WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT BIG DATA?The model of generating/consuming data has changed. The old model was that few companies were generating data; all the others were consuming data. As technology advanced, a new model has evolved. Many companies are now generating and consuming data. But our ultimate goal is not just generating, storing, and managing Big Data. Once data are generated and stored, the next step is to analyze the data to find useful information. Information is then converted into knowledge to make decisions to optimize profit Figure 1 shows an overview of the data analysis and decision making process.The article by Clay Dillow, published in Fortune magazine on September 4, 2013, states that Big Data are now viewed as ""the new oil""to drive the economies in the century ahead, the same way as they did at the beginning of the last century. So, we are experiencing a Big Data employment boom. Dillow's claim is supported by the job trends from indeed.com. Indeed.com is an employment-related meta-search engine for job listings. According to the job trends from indeed.com, the number of job postings related to Big Data increased exponentially after 2011. …","Ying Liu,Ying Liu",Journal of Business Forecasting,2014

The competitive advantage of firms is seen as resting on distinctive processes (ways of coordinating and combining), shaped by the firm's (specific) asset positions (such as the firm's portfolio of difftcult-to- trade knowledge assets and complementary assets), and the evolution path(s) it has aflopted or inherited. The importance of path dependencies is amplified where conditions of increasing retums exist. Whether and how a firm's competitive advantage is eroded depends on the stability of market demand, and the ease of replicability (expanding intemally) and imitatability (replication by competitors). If correct, the framework suggests that private wealth creation in regimes of rapid technological change depends in large measure on honing intemal technological, organizational, and managerial processes inside the firm. In short, identifying new opportunities and organizing effectively and efficiently to embrace them are generally more fundamental to private wealth creation than is strategizing, if by strategizing one means engaging in business conduct that keeps competitors off balance, raises rival's costs, and excludes new entrants. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","David J.

,,,"Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think","Amazon Exclusive: Q&A with Kenneth Cukier and Viktor Mayer-Schonberger Q. What did it take to write Big Data? A. Kenn has written about technology and business from Europe, Asia, and the US for The Economist, and is well-connected to the data community. Viktor had researched the information economy as a professor at Harvard and now at Oxford, and his book Delete had been well received. So we thought we had a good basis to make a contribution in the area. As we wrote the book, we had to dig deep to find unheard stories about big data pioneers and interview them. We wanted Big Data to be about a big idea, but also to be full of examples and success stories -- and be engrossing to read. Q. Are you big datas cheerleaders? A. Absolutely not. We are the messengers of big data, not its evangelists. The big data age is happening, and in the book we take a look at the drivers, and big datas likely trajectory: how it will change how we work and live. We emphasize that the fundamental shift is not in the machines that calculate data, but in the data itself and how we use it. Q. In discovering big data applications, what was your biggest surprise? A. It is tempting to say that it was predicting exploding manholes, tracking inflation in real time, or how big data saves the lives of premature babies. But the biggest surprise for us perhaps was the very diversity of the uses of big data, and how it already is changing peoples everyday world. Many people see big data through the lens of the Internet economy, since Google and Facebook have so much data. But that misses the point: big data is everywhere. Q. Is Big Data then primarily a story about economic efficiency? A. Big data improves economic efficiency, but thats only a very small part of the story. We realized when talking to dozens and dozens of big data pioneers that it improves health care, advances better education, and helps predict societal changefrom urban sprawl to the spread of the flu. Big data is roaring through all sectors of the economy and all areas of life. Q. So big data offers only upside? A. Not at all. We are very concerned about what we call in our book the dark side of big data. However the real challenge is that the problem is not necessarily where we initially tend to think it is, such as surveillance and privacy. After looking into the potential misuses of big data, we became much more troubled by propensity -- that is, big data predictions being used to police and punish. And by the fetishization of data that may occur, whereby organizations may blindly defer to what the data says without understanding its limitations. Q. What can we do about this dark side? A. Knowing about it is the first step. We thought hard to suggest concrete steps that can be taken to minimize and mitigate big datas risk, and came up with a few ways to ensure transparency, guarantee human free will, and strike a better balance on privacy and the use of personal information.

Users specify the computation in terms of a map and a reduce function, and the underlying runtime system automatically parallelizes the computation across large-scale clusters of machines, handles machine failures, and schedules inter-machine communication to make efficient use of the network and disks. Programmers find the system easy to use: more than ten thousand distinct MapReduce programs have been implemented internally at Google over the past four years, and an average of one hundred thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters every day, processing a total of more than twenty petabytes of data per day.","J.

10.1016/j.techfore.2015.12.019,,,Big data analytics: Understanding its capabilities and potential benefits for healthcare organizations,"To date, health care industry has not fully grasped the potential benefits to be gained from big data analytics. While the constantly growing body of academic research on big data analytics is mostly technology oriented, a better understanding of the strategic implications of big data is urgently needed. To address this lack, this study examines the historical development, architectural design and component functionalities of big data analytics. From content analysis of 26 big data implementation cases in healthcare, we were able to identify five big data analytics capabilities: analytical capability for patterns of care, unstructured data analytical capability, decision support capability, predictive capability, and traceability. We also mapped the benefits driven by big data analytics in terms of information technology (IT) infrastructure, operational, organizational, managerial and strategic areas. In addition, we recommend five strategies for healthcare organizations that are considering to adopt big data analytics technologies. Our findings will help healthcare organizations understand the big data analytics capabilities and potential benefits and support them seeking to formulate more effective data-driven analytics strategies.","Yichuan Wang,Yichuan Wang,LeeAnn Kung,LeeAnn Kung,Lee Ann Kung,Terry Anthony Byrd,Terry Anthony Byrd",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,2018

10.1016/j.ijpe.2017.06.006,,,A multidisciplinary perspective of big data in management research,"In recent years, big data has emerged as one of the prominent buzzwords in business and management. In spite of the mounting body of research on big data across the social science disciplines, scholars have offered little synthesis on the current state of knowledge. To take stock of academic research that contributes to the big data revolution, this paper tracks scholarly work's perspectives on big data in the management domain over the past decade. We identify key themes emerging in management studies and develop an integrated framework to link the multiple streams of research in fields of organisation, operations, marketing, information management and other relevant areas. Our analysis uncovers a growing awareness of big data's business values and managerial changes led by data-driven approach. Stemming from the review is the suggestion for research that both structured and unstructured big data should be harnessed to advance understanding of big data value in informing organisational decisions and enhancing firm competitiveness. To discover the full value, firms need to formulate and implement a data-driven strategy. In light of these, the study identifies and outlines the implications and directions for future research.","Jie Sheng,Jie Sheng,Joseph Amankwah‐Amoah,Joseph Amankwah-Amoah,Xiaojun Wang,Xiaojun Wang",International Journal of Production Economics,2017
10.1111/1467-8551.12340,,,"History, Evolution and Future of Big Data and Analytics: A Bibliometric Analysis of Its Relationship to Performance in Organizations","Big data and analytics (BDA) are gaining momentum, particularly in the practitioner world. Research linking BDA to improved organizational performance seems scarce and widely dispersed though, with the majority focused on specific domains and/or macro-level relationships. In order to synthesize past research and advance knowledge of the potential organizational value of BDA, the authors obtained a data set of 327 primary studies and 1252 secondary cited papers. This paper reviews this body of research, using three bibliometric methods. First, it elucidates its intellectual foundations via co-citation analysis. Second, it visualizes the historical evolution of BDA and performance research and its substreams through algorithmic historiography. Third, it provides insights into the field's potential evolution via bibliographic coupling. The results reveal that the academic attention for the BDA-performance link has been increasing rapidly. The study uncovered ten research clusters that form the field's foundation. While research seems to have evolved following two main, isolated streams, the past decade has witnessed more cross-disciplinary collaborations. Moreover, the study identified several research topics undergoing focused development, including financial and customer risk management, text mining and evolutionary algorithms. The review concludes with a discussion of the implications for different functional management domains and the gaps for both research and practice.","Saša Batistič,Sasa Batistic,Paul van der Laken,Paul van der Laken",British Journal of Management,2019

,,,Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage,"Explores the link between a firm's resources and its sustained competitive advantage. For purposes of this analysis, a firm is considered to have a sustained competitive advantage when it is implementing a value creating strategy that no competitor is implementing and when these competitors are unable to duplicate the benefits of this strategy. Strategic resources are assumed to be both heterogeneous and immobile. Value, rareness, imitability, and substitutability are considered in evaluating how useful these firms' resources are for generating sustained competitive advantage. Using the framework developed, three different applications are considered: strategic planning, information processing, and positive reputations. This framework for evaluating sustained competitive advantage can also be used to examine the relationship between strategic management and other disciplines including social welfare, organization theory and behavior, and firm endowments. This analysis leads to the conclusion that firms cannot expect to purchase sustained competitive advantage on the open market, but rather, these firms need to look to resources that are rare, imperfectly imitable, and non-substitutable resources already controlled by the firms.

,,,The economics of well-being.,"GDP is under siege for three main reasons. One is that, even on its own terms, it is flawed: It misses lots of economic activity (unpaid household work, for example) and, as a single-number representation of vast, complex systems, is inevitably skewed. Another is that it fails to factor in economic and environmental sustainability. Finally, existing, readily available measures—educational achievement, life expectancy, and so on—may reflect well-being far better than economic output does.","Dominic Barton,Dominic Barton,Barton D,Justin Fox,David Court,David Court,Court D",Harvard Business Review,2012

This paper develops the concept of IT as an organizational capability and empirically examines the association between IT capability and firm performance. Firm specific IT resources are classified as IT infrastructure, human IT resources, and IT-enabled intangibles. A matched-sample comparison group methodology and publicly available ratings are used to assess IT capability and firm performance. Results indicate that firms with high IT capability tend to outperform a control sample of firms on a variety of profit and cost-based performance measures.","Anandhi Bharadwaj,Anandhi Bharadwaj",Management Information Systems Quarterly,2000

10.1007/s00170-015-7151-x,,,Big Data in product lifecycle management,"Recently, “Big Data” has attracted not only researchers’ but also manufacturers’ attention along with the development of information technology. In this paper, the concept, characteristics, and applications of “Big Data” are briefly introduced first. Then, the various data involved in the three main phases of product lifecycle management (PLM) (i.e., beginning of life, middle of life, and end of life) are concluded and analyzed. But what is the relationship between these PLM data and the term “Big Data”? Whether the “Big Data” concept and techniques can be employed in manufacturing to enhance the intelligence and efficiency of design, production, and service process, and what are the potential applications? Therefore, in order to answer these questions, the existing applications of “Big Data” in PLM are summarized, and the potential applications of “Big Data” techniques in PLM are investigated and pointed out.","Jingran Li,Jingran Li,Jingran Li,Fei Tao,Fei Tao,Ying Cheng,Ying Cheng,Liangjin Zhao,Liangjin Zhao",The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,2015
10.1002/asi.23294,,,"Big data, bigger dilemmas: A critical review","The recent interest in Big Data has generated a broad range of new academic, corporate, and policy practices along with an evolving debate among its proponents, detractors, and skeptics. While the practices draw on a common set of tools, techniques, and technologies, most contributions to the debate come either from a particular disciplinary perspective or with a focus on a domain-specific issue. A close examination of these contributions reveals a set of common problematics that arise in various guises and in different places. It also demonstrates the need for a critical synthesis of the conceptual and practical dilemmas surrounding Big Data. The purpose of this article is to provide such a synthesis by drawing on relevant writings in the sciences, humanities, policy, and trade literature. In bringing these diverse literatures together, we aim to shed light on the common underlying issues that concern and affect all of these areas. By contextualizing the phenomenon of Big Data within larger socioeconomic developments, we also seek to provide a broader understanding of its drivers, barriers, and challenges. This approach allows us to identify attributes of Big Data that require more attention-autonomy, opacity, generativity, disparity, and futurity-leading to questions and ideas for moving beyond dilemmas.","Hamid R.

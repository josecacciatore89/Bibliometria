10.1038/s41568-022-00502-0,36064595,,Big data in basic and translational cancer research,"Historically, the primary focus of cancer research has been molecular and clinical studies of a few essential pathways and genes. Recent years have seen the rapid accumulation of large-scale cancer omics data catalysed by breakthroughs in high-throughput technologies. This fast data growth has given rise to an evolving concept of ‘big data’ in cancer, whose analysis demands large computational resources and can potentially bring novel insights into essential questions. Indeed, the combination of big data, bioinformatics and artificial intelligence has led to notable advances in our basic understanding of cancer biology and to translational advancements. Further advances will require a concerted effort among data scientists, clinicians, biologists and policymakers. Here, we review the current state of the art and future challenges for harnessing big data to advance cancer research and treatment.","Peng Jiang,Peng Jiang,Sanju Sinha,Sanju Sinha,Sanju Sinha,Kenneth Aldape,Kenneth Aldape,Kenneth Aldape,Sridhar Hannenhalli,Sridhar Hannenhalli,Cenk Sahinalp,S.

10.1016/j.agsy.2017.01.023,,,Big Data in Smart Farming – A review,"Smart Farming is a development that emphasizes the use of information and communication technology in the cyber-physical farm management cycle. New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios.","Sjaak Wolfert,Sjaak Wolfert,Lan Ge,Lan Ge,C.N.

At present, we have libraries of over ten thousand synthesized materials and millions of in-silico predicted materials. The fact that we have so many materials opens many exciting avenues to tailor make a material that is optimal for a given application. However, from an experimental and computational point of view we simply have too many materials to screen using brute-force techniques. In this review, we show that having so many materials allows us to use big-data methods as a powerful technique to study these materials and to discover complex correlations. The first part of the review gives an introduction to the principles of big-data science. We emphasize the importance of data collection, methods to augment small data sets, how to select appropriate training sets. An important part of this review are the different approaches that are used to represent these materials in feature space. The review also includes a general overview of the different ML techniques, but as most applications in porous materials use supervised ML our review is focused on the different approaches for supervised ML. In particular, we review the different method to optimize the ML process and how to quantify the performance of the different methods. In the second part, we review how the different approaches of ML have been applied to porous materials. In particular, we discuss applications in the field of gas storage and separation, the stability of these materials, their electronic properties, and their synthesis. The range of topics illustrates the large variety of topics that can be studied with big-data science. Given the increasing interest of the scientific community in ML, we expect this list to rapidly expand in the coming years.","Kevin Maik Jablonka,Daniele Ongari,Seyed Mohamad Moosavi,Berend Smit",arXiv: Materials Science,2020

10.1109/access.2020.2980942,,,Analysis of Dimensionality Reduction Techniques on Big Data,"Due to digitization, a huge volume of data is being generated across several sectors such as healthcare, production, sales, IoT devices, Web, organizations. Machine learning algorithms are used to uncover patterns among the attributes of this data. Hence, they can be used to make predictions that can be used by medical practitioners and people at managerial level to make executive decisions. Not all the attributes in the datasets generated are important for training the machine learning algorithms. Some attributes might be irrelevant and some might not affect the outcome of the prediction. Ignoring or removing these irrelevant or less important attributes reduces the burden on machine learning algorithms. In this work two of the prominent dimensionality reduction techniques, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are investigated on four popular Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Decision Tree Induction, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes Classifier and Random Forest Classifier using publicly available Cardiotocography (CTG) dataset from University of California and Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The experimentation results prove that PCA outperforms LDA in all the measures. Also, the performance of the classifiers, Decision Tree, Random Forest examined is not affected much by using PCA and LDA.To further analyze the performance of PCA and LDA the eperimentation is carried out on Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) datasets. Experimentation results prove that ML algorithms with PCA produce better results when dimensionality of the datasets is high. When dimensionality of datasets is low it is observed that the ML algorithms without dimensionality reduction yields better results.","Thippa Reddy Gadekallu,G. Thippa Reddy,G.

10.1093/aje/kwv254,26994063,,Using Big Data to Emulate a Target Trial When a Randomized Trial Is Not Available,"Abstract Ideally, questions about comparative effectiveness or safety would be answered using an appropriately designed and conducted randomized experiment. When we cannot conduct a randomized experiment, we analyze observational data. Causal inference from large observational databases (big data) can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a randomized experiment-the target experiment or target trial-that would answer the question of interest. When the goal is to guide decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit. This framework channels counterfactual theory for comparing the effects of sustained treatment strategies, organizes analytic approaches, provides a structured process for the criticism of observational studies, and helps avoid common methodologic pitfalls.","Miguel A.

10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.08.001,,,Critical analysis of Big Data challenges and analytical methods,"Big Data (BD), with their potential to ascertain valued insights for enhanced decision-making process, have recently attracted substantial interest from both academics and practitioners. Big Data Analytics (BDA) is increasingly becoming a trending practice that many organizations are adopting with the purpose of constructing valuable information from BD. The analytics process, including the deployment and use of BDA tools, is seen by organizations as a tool to improve operational efficiency though it has strategic potential, drive new revenue streams and gain competitive advantages over business rivals. However, there are different types of analytic applications to consider. Therefore, prior to hasty use and buying costly BD tools, there is a need for organizations to first understand the BDA landscape. Given the significant nature of the BD and BDA, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review that presents a holistic view of the BD challenges and BDA methods theorized/proposed/employed by organizations to help others understand this landscape with the objective of making robust investment decisions. In doing so, systematically analysing and synthesizing the extant research published on BD and BDA area. More specifically, the authors seek to answer the following two principal questions: Q1 – What are the different types of BD challenges theorized/proposed/confronted by organizations? and Q2 – What are the different types of BDA methods theorized/proposed/employed to overcome BD challenges?. This systematic literature review (SLR) is carried out through observing and understanding the past trends and extant patterns/themes in the BDA research area, evaluating contributions, summarizing knowledge, thereby identifying limitations, implications and potential further research avenues to support the academic community in exploring research themes/patterns. Thus, to trace the implementation of BD strategies, a profiling method is employed to analyze articles (published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 1996 and 2015) extracted from the Scopus database. The analysis presented in this paper has identified relevant BD research studies that have contributed both conceptually and empirically to the expansion and accrual of intellectual wealth to the BDA in technology and organizational resource management discipline.","Uthayasankar Sivarajah,Uthayasankar Sivarajah,Muhammad Mustafa Kamal,Muhammad Mustafa Kamal,Zahir Irani,Zahir Irani,Vishanth Weerakkody,Vishanth Weerakkody",Journal of Business Research,2017
10.1186/s40537-021-00468-0,,,Big data quality framework: a holistic approach to continuous quality management,"Abstract Big Data is an essential research area for governments, institutions, and private agencies to support their analytics decisions. Big Data refers to all about data, how it is collected, processed, and analyzed to generate value-added data-driven insights and decisions. Degradation in Data Quality may result in unpredictable consequences. In this case, confidence and worthiness in the data and its source are lost. In the Big Data context, data characteristics, such as volume, multi-heterogeneous data sources, and fast data generation, increase the risk of quality degradation and require efficient mechanisms to check data worthiness. However, ensuring Big Data Quality (BDQ) is a very costly and time-consuming process, since excessive computing resources are required. Maintaining Quality through the Big Data lifecycle requires quality profiling and verification before its processing decision. A BDQ Management Framework for enhancing the pre-processing activities while strengthening data control is proposed. The proposed framework uses a new concept called Big Data Quality Profile. This concept captures quality outline, requirements, attributes, dimensions, scores, and rules. Using Big Data profiling and sampling components of the framework, a faster and efficient data quality estimation is initiated before and after an intermediate pre-processing phase. The exploratory profiling component of the framework plays an initial role in quality profiling; it uses a set of predefined quality metrics to evaluate important data quality dimensions. It generates quality rules by applying various pre-processing activities and their related functions. These rules mainly aim at the Data Quality Profile and result in quality scores for the selected quality attributes. The framework implementation and dataflow management across various quality management processes have been discussed, further some ongoing work on framework evaluation and deployment to support quality evaluation decisions conclude the paper.","Ikbal Taleb,Ikbal Taleb,Mohamed Adel Serhani,Mohamed Adel Serhani,Chafik Bouhaddioui,Chafik Bouhaddioui,Rachida Dssouli,Rachida Dssouli",Journal of Big Data,2021

Data-mining technology has been a frontier field in medical research, as it demonstrates excellent performance in evaluating patient risks and assisting clinical decision-making in building disease-prediction models. Therefore, data mining has unique advantages in clinical big-data research, especially in large-scale medical public databases. This article introduced the main medical public database and described the steps, tasks, and models of data mining in simple language. Additionally, we described data-mining methods along with their practical applications.

10.1109/tits.2014.2345663,,,Traffic Flow Prediction With Big Data: A Deep Learning Approach,"Accurate and timely traffic flow information is important for the successful deployment of intelligent transportation systems. Over the last few years, traffic data have been exploding, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation. Existing traffic flow prediction methods mainly use shallow traffic prediction models and are still unsatisfying for many real-world applications. This situation inspires us to rethink the traffic flow prediction problem based on deep architecture models with big traffic data. In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based traffic flow prediction method is proposed, which considers the spatial and temporal correlations inherently. A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic traffic flow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep architecture model is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent traffic flow features for prediction. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for traffic flow prediction has superior performance.","Yisheng Lv,Yisheng Lv,Yanjie Duan,Yanjie Duan,Wenwen Kang,Wenwen Kang,Zhengxi Li,Zhengxi Li,Fei‐Yue Wang,Fei-Yue Wang,Fei-Yue Wang",IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,2015

However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively.","Fei Tao,Fei Tao,Jiangfeng Cheng,Jiangfeng Cheng,Qinglin Qi,Qinglin Qi,Meng Zhang,Meng Zhang,Meng Zhang,He Zhang,He Zhang,Fangyuan Sui,Fangyuan Sui",The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,2018

Researchers should be familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of current implementations of GBDT’s in order to use them effectively and make successful contributions. CatBoost is a member of the family of GBDT machine learning ensemble techniques. Since its debut in late 2018, researchers have successfully used CatBoost for machine learning studies involving Big Data. We take this opportunity to review recent research on CatBoost as it relates to Big Data, and learn best practices from studies that cast CatBoost in a positive light, as well as studies where CatBoost does not outshine other techniques, since we can learn lessons from both types of scenarios. Furthermore, as a Decision Tree based algorithm, CatBoost is well-suited to machine learning tasks involving categorical, heterogeneous data. Recent work across multiple disciplines illustrates CatBoost’s effectiveness and shortcomings in classification and regression tasks. Another important issue we expose in literature on CatBoost is its sensitivity to hyper-parameters and the importance of hyper-parameter tuning. One contribution we make is to take an interdisciplinary approach to cover studies related to CatBoost in a single work. This provides researchers an in-depth understanding to help clarify proper application of CatBoost in solving problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that studies all works related to CatBoost in a single publication.","John Hancock,John T. Hancock,Taghi M. Khoshgoftaar,Taghi M.

,23074865,,Big data: the management revolution.,"Big data, the authors write, is far more powerful than the analytics of the past. Executives can measure and therefore manage more precisely than ever before. They can make better predictions and smarter decisions. They can target more-effective interventions in areas that so far have been dominated by gut and intuition rather than by data and rigor. The differences between big data and analytics are a matter of volume, velocity, and variety: More data now cross the internet every second than were stored in the entire internet 20 years ago. Nearly real-time information makes it possible for a company to be much more agile than its competitors. And that information can come from social networks, images, sensors, the web, or other unstructured sources. The managerial challenges, however, are very real. Senior decision makers have to learn to ask the right questions and embrace evidence-based decision making. Organizations must hire scientists who can find patterns in very large data sets and translate them into useful business information. IT departments have to work hard to integrate all the relevant internal and external sources of data. The authors offer two success stories to illustrate how companies are using big data: PASSUR Aerospace enables airlines to match their actual and estimated arrival times.

However, we have a limited understanding of the content of these corpora, including general statistics, quality, social factors, and inclusion of evaluation data (contamination). In this work, we propose What's In My Big Data? (WIMBD), a platform and a set of sixteen analyses that allow us to reveal and compare the contents of large text corpora. WIMBD builds on two basic capabilities -- count and search -- at scale, which allows us to analyze more than 35 terabytes on a standard compute node. We apply WIMBD to ten different corpora used to train popular language models, including C4, The Pile, and RedPajama. Our analysis uncovers several surprising and previously undocumented findings about these corpora, including the high prevalence of duplicate, synthetic, and low-quality content, personally identifiable information, toxic language, and benchmark contamination. For instance, we find that about 50% of the documents in RedPajama and LAION-2B-en are duplicates. In addition, several datasets used for benchmarking models trained on such corpora are contaminated with respect to important benchmarks, including the Winograd Schema Challenge and parts of GLUE and SuperGLUE.

This paper highlights the need to develop appropriate and efficient analytical methods to leverage massive volumes of heterogeneous data in unstructured text, audio, and video formats. This paper also reinforces the need to devise new tools for predictive analytics for structured big data. The statistical methods in practice were devised to infer from sample data. The heterogeneity, noise, and the massive size of structured big data calls for developing computationally efficient algorithms that may avoid big data pitfalls, such as spurious correlation.","Amir H.

,,2104.05704,Escaping the Big Data Paradigm with Compact Transformers,"With the rise of Transformers as the standard for language processing, and their advancements in computer vision, there has been a corresponding growth in parameter size and amounts of training data. Many have come to believe that because of this, transformers are not suitable for small sets of data. This trend leads to concerns such as: limited availability of data in certain scientific domains and the exclusion of those with limited resource from research in the field. In this paper, we aim to present an approach for small-scale learning by introducing Compact Transformers. We show for the first time that with the right size, convolutional tokenization, transformers can avoid overfitting and outperform state-of-the-art CNNs on small datasets. Our models are flexible in terms of model size, and can have as little as 0.28M parameters while achieving competitive results. Our best model can reach 98% accuracy when training from scratch on CIFAR-10 with only 3.7M parameters, which is a significant improvement in data-efficiency over previous Transformer based models being over 10x smaller than other transformers and is 15% the size of ResNet50 while achieving similar performance. CCT also outperforms many modern CNN based approaches, and even some recent NAS-based approaches. Additionally, we obtain a new SOTA result on Flowers-102 with 99.76% top-1 accuracy, and improve upon the existing baseline on ImageNet (82.71% accuracy with 29% as many parameters as ViT), as well as NLP tasks. Our simple and compact design for transformers makes them more feasible to study for those with limited computing resources and/or dealing with small datasets, while extending existing research efforts in data efficient transformers. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Compact-Transformers.","Ali Hassani,Steven Walton,Nikhil Shah,Abulikemu Abuduweili,Jiachen Li,Humphrey Shi",arXiv.org,2021

A persistent source of ""big data,"" or data that is enormous in volume, diverse in type, and has a complicated multidimensional structure, is internet applications and communications. Today, several measures are routinely performed with no assurance that any of them will be helpful in understanding the phenomenon of interest in an era of automatic, large-scale data collection. Online transactions that involve buying, selling, or even investing are all examples of e-commerce. As a result, they generate data that has a complex structure and a high dimension. The usual data storage techniques cannot handle those enormous volumes of data. There is a lot of work being done to find ways to minimize the dimensionality of big data in order to provide analytics reports that are even more accurate and data visualizations that are more interesting. As a result, the purpose of this survey study is to give an overview of big data analytics along with related problems and issues that go beyond technology.","Wasnaa Kadhim Jawad,Abbas M.

The paper aims at analyzing the possibilities of using Big Data Analytics in healthcare. The research is based on a critical analysis of the literature, as well as the presentation of selected results of direct research on the use of Big Data Analytics in medical facilities. The direct research was carried out based on research questionnaire and conducted on a sample of 217 medical facilities in Poland. Literature studies have shown that the use of Big Data Analytics can bring many benefits to medical facilities, while direct research has shown that medical facilities in Poland are moving towards data-based healthcare because they use structured and unstructured data, reach for analytics in the administrative, business and clinical area. The research positively confirmed that medical facilities are working on both structural data and unstructured data. The following kinds and sources of data can be distinguished: from databases, transaction data, unstructured content of emails and documents, data from devices and sensors. However, the use of data from social media is lower as in their activity they reach for analytics, not only in the administrative and business but also in the clinical area. It clearly shows that the decisions made in medical facilities are highly data-driven. The results of the study confirm what has been analyzed in the literature that medical facilities are moving towards data-based healthcare, together with its benefits.","Kornelia Batko,Kornelia Batko,Andrzej Ślęzak,Andrzej Ślęzak",Journal of Big Data,2022

10.2139/ssrn.2477899,,,Big Data's Disparate Impact,"Advocates of algorithmic techniques like data mining argue that these techniques eliminate human biases from the decision-making process. But an algorithm is only as good as the data it works with. Data is frequently imperfect in ways that allow these algorithms to inherit the prejudices of prior decision makers. In other cases, data may simply reflect the widespread biases that persist in society at large. In still others, data mining can discover surprisingly useful regularities that are really just preexisting patterns of exclusion and inequality. Unthinking reliance on data mining can deny historically disadvantaged and vulnerable groups full participation in society. Worse still, because the resulting discrimination is almost always an unintentional emergent property of the algorithm’s use rather than a conscious choice by its programmers, it can be unusually hard to identify the source of the problem or to explain it to a court.This Essay examines these concerns through the lens of American antidiscrimination law — more particularly, through Title VII’s prohibition of discrimination in employment. In the absence of a demonstrable intent to discriminate, the best doctrinal hope for data mining’s victims would seem to lie in disparate impact doctrine. Case law and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Uniform Guidelines, though, hold that a practice can be justified as a business necessity when its outcomes are predictive of future employment outcomes, and data mining is specifically designed to find such statistical correlations. Unless there is a reasonably practical way to demonstrate that these discoveries are spurious, Title VII would appear to bless its use, even though the correlations it discovers will often reflect historic patterns of prejudice, others’ discrimination against members of protected groups, or flaws in the underlying dataAddressing the sources of this unintentional discrimination and remedying the corresponding deficiencies in the law will be difficult technically, difficult legally, and difficult politically. There are a number of practical limits to what can be accomplished computationally. For example, when discrimination occurs because the data being mined is itself a result of past intentional discrimination, there is frequently no obvious method to adjust historical data to rid it of this taint. Corrective measures that alter the results of the data mining after it is complete would tread on legally and politically disputed terrain. These challenges for reform throw into stark relief the tension between the two major theories underlying antidiscrimination law: anticlassification and antisubordination. Finding a solution to big data’s disparate impact will require more than best efforts to stamp out prejudice and bias; it will require a wholesale reexamination of the meanings of “discrimination” and “fairness.”","Solon Barocas,Solon Barocas,Andrew D.

10.3390/bdcc6040101,,,An Efficient and Secure Big Data Storage in Cloud Environment by Using Triple Data Encryption Standard,"In recent decades, big data analysis has become the most important research topic. Hence, big data security offers Cloud application security and monitoring to host highly sensitive data to support Cloud platforms. However, the privacy and security of big data has become an emerging issue that restricts the organization to utilize Cloud services. The existing privacy preserving approaches showed several drawbacks such as a lack of data privacy and accurate data analysis, a lack of efficiency of performance, and completely rely on third party. In order to overcome such an issue, the Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) methodology is proposed to provide security for big data in the Cloud environment. The proposed TDES methodology provides a relatively simpler technique by increasing the sizes of keys in Data Encryption Standard (DES) to protect against attacks and defend the privacy of data. The experimental results showed that the proposed TDES method is effective in providing security and privacy to big healthcare data in the Cloud environment. The proposed TDES methodology showed less encryption and decryption time compared to the existing Intelligent Framework for Healthcare Data Security (IFHDS) method.","Mohan Naik Ramachandra,Mohan Naik Ramachandra,Madala Srinivasa Rao,Madala Srinivasa Rao,Sheng-Lyang Jang,Wen‐Cheng Lai,B.

10.3389/frai.2020.00004,33733124,,An Introductory Review of Deep Learning for Prediction Models With Big Data.,"Deep learning models stand for a new learning paradigm in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Recent breakthrough results in image analysis and speech recognition have generated a massive interest in this field because also applications in many other domains providing big data seem possible. On a downside, the mathematical and computational methodology underlying deep learning models is very challenging especially for interdisciplinary scientists. For this reason, we present in this paper an introductory review of deep learning approaches including Deep Feedforward Neural Networks (D-FFNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Autoencoders (AEs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These models form the major core architectures of deep learning models currently used and should belong to any data scientist's toolbox. Importantly, those core architectural building blocks can be composed flexibly - in an almost Lego-like manner - to build new application-specific network architectures. Hence, a basic understanding of these network architectures is important to be prepared for future developments in AI.","Frank Emmert‐Streib,Frank Emmert-Streib,Frank Emmert-Streib,Zhen Yang,Zhen Yang,Feng Han,Han Feng,Shailesh Tripathi,Shailesh Tripathi,Matthias Dehmer,Matthias Dehmer,Matthias Dehmer",Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,2020
10.1186/s40537-020-00320-x,,,A comprehensive survey of anomaly detection techniques for high dimensional big data,"Anomaly detection in high dimensional data is becoming a fundamental research problem that has various applications in the real world. However, many existing anomaly detection techniques fail to retain sufficient accuracy due to so-called “big data” characterised by high-volume, and high-velocity data generated by variety of sources. This phenomenon of having both problems together can be referred to the “curse of big dimensionality,” that affect existing techniques in terms of both performance and accuracy. To address this gap and to understand the core problem, it is necessary to identify the unique challenges brought by the anomaly detection with both high dimensionality and big data problems. Hence, this survey aims to document the state of anomaly detection in high dimensional big data by representing the unique challenges using a triangular model of vertices: the problem (big dimensionality), techniques/algorithms (anomaly detection), and tools (big data applications/frameworks). Authors’ work that fall directly into any of the vertices or closely related to them are taken into consideration for review. Furthermore, the limitations of traditional approaches and current strategies of high dimensional data are discussed along with recent techniques and applications on big data required for the optimization of anomaly detection.","Srikanth Thudumu,Srikanth Thudumu,Philip Branch,Philip Branch,Jiong Jin,Jiong Jin,Jugdutt Jack Singh,Jugdutt Jack Singh",Journal of Big Data,2020

In recent years, applications of big data and AI in education have made significant headways. This highlights a novel trend in leading-edge educational research. The convenience and embeddedness of data collection within educational technologies, paired with computational techniques have made the analyses of big data a reality. We are moving beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations and applications of techniques, and are beginning to see substantial adoption in many areas of education. The key research trends in the domains of big data and AI are associated with assessment, individualized learning, and precision education. Model-driven data analytics approaches will grow quickly to guide the development, interpretation, and validation of the algorithms. However, conclusions from educational analytics should, of course, be applied with caution. At the education policy level, the government should be devoted to supporting lifelong learning, offering teacher education programs, and protecting personal data. With regard to the education industry, reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationships should be developed in order to enhance academia-industry collaboration. Furthermore, it is important to make sure that technologies are guided by relevant theoretical frameworks and are empirically tested. Lastly, in this paper we advocate an in-depth dialogue between supporters of “cold” technology and “warm” humanity so that it can lead to greater understanding among teachers and students about how technology, and specifically, the big data explosion and AI revolution can bring new opportunities (and challenges) that can be best leveraged for pedagogical practices and learning.","Hui Luan,Hui Luan,Peter Géczy,Peter Géczy,Hollis Lai,Hollis Lai,Janice D.

10.1186/s40537-021-00419-9,,,A survey on data‐efficient algorithms in big data era,"The leading approaches in Machine Learning are notoriously data-hungry. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data because acquiring data involves a process that is expensive or time-consuming. This has triggered a serious debate in both the industrial and academic communities calling for more data-efficient models that harness the power of artificial learners while achieving good results with less training data and in particular less human supervision. In light of this debate, this work investigates the issue of algorithms’ data hungriness. First, it surveys the issue from different perspectives. Then, it presents a comprehensive review of existing data-efficient methods and systematizes them into four categories. Specifically, the survey covers solution strategies that handle data-efficiency by (i) using non-supervised algorithms that are, by nature, more data-efficient, by (ii) creating artificially more data, by (iii) transferring knowledge from rich-data domains into poor-data domains, or by (iv) altering data-hungry algorithms to reduce their dependency upon the amount of samples, in a way they can perform well in small samples regime. Each strategy is extensively reviewed and discussed. In addition, the emphasis is put on how the four strategies interplay with each other in order to motivate exploration of more robust and data-efficient algorithms. Finally, the survey delineates the limitations, discusses research challenges, and suggests future opportunities to advance the research on data-efficiency in machine learning.",Amina Adadi,Journal of Big Data,2021

Under such conditions, modeling and detecting instances of the minority class is very difficult. One-class classification (OCC) is an approach to detect abnormal data points compared to the instances of the known class and can serve to address issues related to severely imbalanced datasets, which are especially very common in big data. We present a detailed survey of OCC-related literature works published over the last decade, approximately. We group the different works into three categories: outlier detection, novelty detection, and deep learning and OCC. We closely examine and evaluate selected works on OCC such that a good cross section of approaches, methods, and application domains is represented in the survey. Commonly used techniques in OCC for outlier detection and for novelty detection, respectively, are discussed. We observed one area that has been largely omitted in OCC-related literature is its application context for big data and its inherently associated problems, such as severe class imbalance, class rarity, noisy data, feature selection, and data reduction.

10.1080/00087041.2024.2323333,,,Evaluating the Geometry of Objects in Cartographic Generalization with Hu's Invariants,"ABSTRACT This paper presents a novel approach to assessing the geometry of objects using Hu's invariants in the context of cartographic generalization. The primary focus is to improve the generalization process and produce more readable and informative maps. The study demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of the modified invariant moment M1* in evaluating regular shape similarity. Experiments, based on 24 shapes, exhibit greater stability in the results and reveal the high suitability of this moment in the investigation and classification of buildings, among other generalization processes. The efficiency of the proposed method is compared to previous generalization techniques, showing a significant improvement in the generalization process. In conclusion, this research contributes to the development of cartographic generalization methods by introducing the use of Hu's invariants for evaluating object geometry. This approach can improve the automation of map generalization processes and more effective communication of geographic information.","Joanna Bac-Bronowicz,K. Kozioł,Andrzej Kwinta,C.

10.16879/jkca.2021.21.2.029,,,Cartographic Generalization of Digital Boundary Files of the Korean Administrative Areal Units: Making Base Maps for Thematic Mapping,"The main objective of this study is to offer properly generalized digital files of Korea administrative boundaries for thematic mapping. In a theoretical concern, the digital generalization model proposed by McMaster and Shea is intensively reviewed, and two major simplification algorithms, the Douglas-Peuker algorithm and the Visvalingam-Whyatt algorithm, are thoroughly compared. As a result, a modified version of the Visvalingam-Whyatt algorithm is selected mainly because it is better in preserving the contiguity property among the original areal units and in performing the smoothing operation while simplifying map features. The generalization framework is applied to the 2020 boundary file of the most detailed administrative areal units in South Korea targeting for 1:4,000,000 and 1:8,000,000 map scales. By comparing the generalized maps created at the 8 different vertex retention rates, it is concluded that the 0.2% retention rate map is suitable for the 1:4,000,000 scale and the 0.05% retention rate map is for the 1:8,000,000 scale. This study is expected to help people avoid the use of the far too detailed raw boundary files and/or the far too scant generalized files, and can be seen as a cornerstone of a broader project to construct a standardized set of administrative boundary files which are designed in compliance with different map scales that people freely use for their needs.","Hyun-Mi Kim,Hyunmi Kim,Lee S,한국교육과정평가원,Sang Il Lee",Journal of the Korean Cartographic Association,2021
,,,Multi-Agents Systems for Cartographic Generalization: Feedback from Past and On-going Research,"Cartographic generalization is a highly local and contextual process where decisions are taken locally to better adjust the transformations used to the local geography. Thus, carto-graphic generalization fits well with the multi-agents paradigm that promotes decentralized and autonomous decision-making. The past years of research in cartographic generalization showed several successful attempts to use multi-agents systems, and this paper provides a feedback on these attempts. We extracted a core modeling of a multi-agents system for generalization and highlighted its main components. Previous propositions of multi-agents generalization processes are described in relation to this core modeling, and feedbacks from experimentations with these processes are discussed to define a research agenda in multi-agents modeling for generalization.","Cécile Duchêne,Guillaume Touya,Cécile Duchêne,Guillaume Touya,Cécile Duchêne,Guillaume Touya,Guillaume Touya,Guillaume Touya,Patrick Taillandier,Patrick Taillandier,Patrick Taillandier,Patrick Taillandier,Julien Gaffuri,Julien Gaffuri,Anne Ruas,Anne Ruas,Anne Ruas,Anne Ruas,Jérémy Renard,Jérémy Renard",,2018
10.3390/ijgi13050154,,,Collaborative Methods of Resolving Road Graphic Conflicts Based on Cartographic Rules and Generalization Operations,"The resolution of road graphic conflicts is a key aspect of map generalization, which involves both scale reduction and the symbolization of map features. This study proposes collaborative methods of road graphic conflict resolution considering different road characteristics. These methods consider both geometric and semantic characteristics, and they incorporate the bend characteristics of roads, the road symbol size, and road semantics. Constrained Delaunay triangulation skeleton lines are used to categorize road graphic conflicts, which are made up of four independent conflict types and four group conflict types. Based on their characteristics, three collaborative methods are designed to deal with the different types of road graphic conflicts: collaboration between deletion and the snake displacement model, collaboration between the snake displacement model and collinearity, and collaboration among simplification, smoothing, and the beam displacement model. Two types of independent conflicts can be processed using only one simple operation. This study summarizes the cartographic rules for resolving road graphic conflicts, and these are used along with geometric features to drive the collaborative methods or one simple operation presented here. The experimental results indicate that the method proposed in this study can effectively resolve road graphic conflicts.","Chuanbang Zheng,Q. Guo,Lin Wang,Yuangang Liu,Jianfeng Jiang",ISPRS Int. J.

It includes the study of the geographic environment, processing of geographic data, and an evaluation with regard to type, purpose, and scale of the map, or selecting and merging their graphical presentation, with a big or small degree of abstraction. In the era of digital cartography more attention is paid to developing tools for automatic generalization of cartographic content.

10.1515/pcr-2017-0001,,,Cartographic generalization yesterday and today,"Abstract The author presents evolution of views on cartographic generalization since it was defined by Emil von Sydow (1866) until today. It is divided into three chapters which present the evolution of views on cartographic generalization, models of generalization and digital generalization, respectively. Views on the topic of generalization evolved in the direction of broadening the term itself and towards a different perception of its nature. Originally generalization was understood as a process which can be performed on maps only. Now the prevailing understanding is that it begins earlier, at the conceptual stage of map making. Determination of the method of contents’ presentation is an indication of such generalization. The character of generalization is another important aspect of the discussion on its nature. The notion of a subjective nature of generalization, expressed, among others, by Max Eckert (1921), was originally predominant. Later there also appeared different opinions, allowing its objectivization (K.A. Saliszczew 1998). This direction helped to result in automation of the process of generalization of map contents. Currently a dualism in perceiving generalization can be observed, with a strong bias towards its objective aspect. In a separate chapter the author discusses conceptual models of generalization proposed by: L. Ratajski (1967, 1973), J. Morrison (1974), B.G. Nickerson (1988), K.E. Brassel and R. Weibel (1988), as well as R.B. McMaster and K.S. Shea (1992). They are divided into the universal models of theoretical character and those constructed for the purpose of computer automation of the process. Attempts at digital generalization which currently develop in the context of generalization of general, and especially topographic maps, are discussed separately. Most important algorithms concerning generalization of linear objects are presented chronologically, concluding with a description of comprehensive generalization systems. The summary presents two main conclusions. Firstly – work on generalization will continue to consider the geographical context during the process. Secondly – generalization of thematic, and especially statistical maps is the prospective direction.","Paweł Cebrykow,Paweł Cebrykow",Polish Cartographical Review,2017

10.1109/access.2019.2961622,,,Combined Matching Approach of Road Networks Under Different Scales Considering Constraints of Cartographic Generalization,"Identifying corresponding objects from geospatial databases at different levels of detail is crucial, especially in multi-scale road network matching, which is the prerequisite of data conflation, updating and quality assessment. `Stroke' has a considerable effect on automatic road network generalization, and is essential in the road network matching process. In road network generalization, topological relationships may change, and some roads may be deleted. In this paper, we propose a combined stroke-based matching approach of road networks considering the constraints of cartographic generalization for road networks under different scales. In the entire stroke matching, we utilize the modified Hausdorff distance for geometric similarity. We consider the topological differences in the structural similarity calculation and propose a new weight calculation method. Partial stroke matching can further identify the corresponding roads with changes and updates in different scales. We also propose a method of roundabout detection and matching. The proposed approach could not only match road networks with a small scale difference, but also road networks with a large scale difference. And it can successfully identify the M:N, M:1, 1:1, 1/M:1/N, and 1/M:1 matching relationships. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by experimental results.","Guo Qingsheng,Qingsheng Guo,Xinglin Xu,Xinglin Xu,Xinglin Xu,Yong Wang,Yong Wang,Jiping Liu,Jiping Liu,Jiping Liu",IEEE Access,2020

10.1007/978-981-16-0614-4_5,,,Cartographic Generalization,"Cartographic generalization has always been one of the most challenging and creative fields in cartography. Automated generalization of spatial data under a digital environment is still one of the core issues that modern cartography faces. First, the automated cartographic generalization method must be used when producing smaller scale maps by means of large-scale digital map data; second, the automatic cartographic generalization method is the most effective way to solve the automatic derivation of a multiscale spatial database based on a large-scale basic spatial database and the integrated updating of a multiscale spatial database; third, to meet the requirements of the multiscale expression of geographic information system data, the automatic generalization method must be adopted and should be online; and fourth, in the construction of a spatial data warehouse, the automatic generalization method should be used to extract the required spatial data from heterogeneous databases in different places and departments according to the user theme (problem solving). It is because of the importance of the automatic generalization of spatial data that international academia has given full attention to research in this field for a long time, especially in the past 10 years, and a large number of valuable theoretical and technological achievements have been obtained. However, because of the complexity in the automatic generalization of spatial data, there is a certain gap between the present study results and a global solution to the problem, which is a practical application. This gap is not only because of the technical realization but also because of the ideological conception.","Fang Wu,Fang Wu,Jiayao Wang,Jiayao Wang",Advances in Cartography and Geographic Information Engineering,2021

The commonly used generalization methods are based on procedures for processing spatial databases where the DLM and/or the DCM are stored. The authors have proposed new solutions for large-and small-scale maps generalization on the example of river network objects. The first stage of process takes into account the hierarchy of watercourses resulting from the Map of Hydrographic Division of Poland (MPHP). The condition of entire watercourse recognition is checked iteratively considering the changing topology. In the second stage, scaledriven generalization (simplification) is carried out, taking into account the width of the symbol.

10.1111/tgis.12165,,,An Immune Genetic Algorithm to Buildings Displacement in Cartographic Generalization,"Spatial conflicts may occur when map data are displayed at a scale smaller than that of the source map. This study applies the displacement operator in cartographic generalization to resolve such spatial conflicts and to improve the clarity and legibility of map. The immune genetic algorithm (IGA) is used in this study for buildings displacement to solve conflicts. IGA is based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and employs the self-adjusting mechanism of antibody concentration to enhance population diversity. Meanwhile, the elitism retention strategy is adopted in IGA to guarantee that the best individual (antibody) is not lost and destroyed in the next generation to strengthen convergence efficiency. The compared experiment between IGA and GA shows that the displacement result produced by IGA performs better than GA. Finally, in order to make the displaced map more attractive to cartographers, two constraints – the building alignment constraint and building tangent relation constraint – are applied in IGA to restrict the buildings’ displacement. The same experimental data are adopted to prove that the improved IGA is useful for maintaining the two constraints.","Yageng Sun,Yageng Sun,Guo Qingsheng,Qingsheng Guo,Qingsheng Guo,Yuangang Liu,Yuangang Liu,Xiao Ma,Xiaoya Ma,Jie Weng,Jie Weng",Transactions in Gis,2016

The research agenda explicitly focuses on challenges regarding design, and we begin by establishing a partial design space for mobile-first and responsive maps and visualizations, situating these design considerations within the constraints, enablements, and consequences of mobile technology. Specifically, we present 20 research challenges facing mobile-first and responsive cartography and visualization, with research challenges organized by five dimensions (i.e., sets of design decisions) of the design space: (1) scale and generalization, (2) projections, (3) symbolization and visual hierarchy, (4) toponymy and typography, and (5) user interaction. The agenda crosses and organizes a range of research foci in cartography and visualization – such as augmented/mixed reality, indoor/outdoor mapping, egocentrism, focus+context techniques, energy-aware design, glanceable visualization, visual storytelling, UI/UX design, multi-modal and embodied interaction, and inclusive design – centering conceptual, practical, and critical questions for design throughout.","Robert E.

10.1111/tgis.13246,,,Knowledge‐Guided Automated Cartographic Generalization Process Construction: A Case Study Based on Map Analysis of Public Maps of China,"The efficacy of conveying information through maps heavily depends on the quality of map generalization. However, automating map generalization poses a complex decision‐making challenge, requiring a profound understanding of the process—specifically, knowledge about the generalization procedure. Currently, there is a scarcity of research on the sequence of generalization operations, particularly for cartographic generalization involving symbolization and labeling. On the contrary, customary maps generated in practical applications consistently adhere to the specified generalization and symbolization protocol, which makes it feasible and credible to construct this overall process based on expert knowledge. To reconcile this incongruity, this paper presents a knowledge‐guided automated cartographic generalization process construction. Firstly, an exhaustive examination of the sequential procedures involved in manual generalization and a well‐applied automated generalization system are delineated, drawing upon map analysis methodologies, observations, and expert interviews. Then, elaborate guidelines governing each phase within this process, particularly concerning the symbolization and labeling of map features, are explored. Ultimately, details of the expert interview are described and a map generalized by the well‐applied system is analyzed. The results show that the automated generalization system follows the knowledge‐guided process in this paper can significantly improve production efficiency in practice, this study serves as a connection between cartographers and developers and may help achieve a higher level of automated cartographic generalization.","Xiaorong Gao,Haowen Yan,Zhongkui Chen,Panfei Yin",Trans.

10.15291/geoadria.86,,,Cartographic Generalization and Contributions to its Automation,"The purpose of cartographic generalization is to represent a particular situation adapted to the needs of its users, with adequate legibility of the real situation and its perceptional congruity with the representation. Interesting are those situations which to some degree vary from the real situation in nature. This is purposeful generalization where attention is directed towards particular, thematically valuable objects and their details. Difficulties in accomplishment of the cartographic generalization objectives are reflected in the basic approach. Some cartographers encourage the idea of complete prevalence of subjective approach to the process, yet accepting partial solutions that enable automated data processing of certain chart elements. Others stand for objectifying of all procedures, or schematic solving of all issues in the process, which will gradually lead up to the level where it could be termed automated. The latter is considered more acceptable by the authors of this paper, implying the necessary human intervention in the generalization, yet not to determine the course of the process, but just to act as a mediator.","Zlatimir Bičanić,Zlatimir Bićanić,Radovan Solarić,Radovan Solarić",,2017

10.3390/ijgi7120477,,,Cartographic Line Generalization Based on Radius of Curvature Analysis,"Cartographic generalization is one of the important processes of transforming the content of both analogue and digital maps. The process of reducing details on the map has to be conducted in a planned way in each case when the map scale is to be reduced. As far as digital maps are concerned, numerous algorithms are used for the generalization of vector line elements. They are used if the scale of the map (on screen or printed) is changed, or in the process of smoothing vector lines (e.g., contours). The most popular method of reducing the number of vertices of a vector line is the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. An important feature of most algorithms is the fact that they do not take into account the cartographic properties of the transformed map element. Having analysed the existing methods of generalization, the authors developed a proprietary algorithm that is based on the analysis of the curvature of the vector line and fulfils the condition of objective generalization for elements of digital maps that may be used to transform open and closed vector lines. The paper discusses the operation of this algorithm, along with the graphic presentation of the generalization results for vector lines and the analysis of their accuracy. Treating the set of verification radii of a vector line as a statistical series, the authors propose applying statistical indices of position of these series, connected with the shape of the vector line, as the threshold parameters of generalization. The developed algorithm allows for linking the generalization parameters directly to the scale of the topographic map that was obtained after generalization. The results of the operation of the algorithm were compared to the results of the reduction of vertices with use of the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. The results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm not only reduced the number of vertices, but that it also smoothed the shape of physiographic lines, if applied to them. The authors demonstrated that the errors of smoothing and position of vertices did not exceed the acceptable values for the relevant scales of topographic maps. The developed algorithm allows for adjusting the surface of the generalized areas to their initial value more precisely. The advantage of the developed algorithm consists in the possibility to apply statistical indices that take the shape of lines into account to define the generalization parameters.","Bogdan Kolanowski,Bogdan Kolanowski,J.

10.1007/978-3-319-07926-4_30,,,On Shape Metrics in Cartographic Generalization: A Case Study of the Building Footprint Geometry,"There are various methods, algorithms and automated tools for geometry generalization, however cartographers’ knowledge and experiences are crucial for a decision of what generalization level is suitable for the final visualization. This decision of experienced cartographer is usually correct but still quite subjective. Due to this reason we introduce the shape metrics as a tool to support objective evaluation of a generalization level. Shape metrics were originally applied in the landscape ecology in order to quantify landscape patches. Since then many scientific disciplines, including Geosciences, have adopted their principles. Generally, shape metrics serves as a quantitative description of any planar object (e.g. ground projection of a building) in order to measure its shape complexity or compactness. We used 15 shape metrics to calculate complexity of four buildings ground plans at 22 generalization levels in our case study. First, we performed shape generalization of four architecturally different buildings ground plans in consecutive levels. Then, we calculated shape metrics for each generalization level to quantify generalized shape complexity. We found out that shape metrics confirmed the fact that the higher level of geometry generalization the lower shape complexity. Nevertheless some shape metrics revealed that, in certain levels of generalization, the shape was not simplified. Aim of this paper is to introduce shape metrics application on geometry generalization in a case study and to propose suitable shape metrics to identify particular levels of an improper geometry generalization.","Vít Pásztó,Vít Pászto,Alžběta Brychtová,Alžběta Brychtová,L.

Previous studies show that the dual graph for street–street relationships more accurately reflects the overall morphological properties and importance of streets than do other methods. In this study, we construct a dual graph to represent street–street relationship and propose an approach to generalize street networks based on gravitational field theory. We retain the global structural properties and topological connectivity of an original street network and borrow from gravitational field theory to define the gravitational force between nodes. The concept of multi-order neighbors is introduced and the gravitational force is taken as the measure of the importance contribution between nodes. The importance of a node is defined as the result of the interaction between a given node and its multi-order neighbors. Degree distribution is used to evaluate the level of maintaining the global structure and topological characteristics of a street network and to illustrate the efficiency of the suggested method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can be used in generalizing street networks and retaining their density characteristics, connectivity and global structure.","Gang Liu,Gang Liu,Yongshu Li,Yongshu Li,Y.

10.3390/rs16162971,,,Cartographic Generalization of Islands Using Remote Sensing Images for Multiscale Representation,"The multi-scale representation of remote sensing images provides various levels of image information crucial for decision-making in GIS applications and plays a significant role in information processing, data analysis, and geographic modeling. Traditional methods for multi-scale representation of remote sensing images often struggle to simplify local details of individual targets while preserving the overall characteristics of target groups. These methods also encounter issues such as transitional texture distortion and rough final boundaries. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale representation method for remote sensing images based on computer vision techniques, which effectively maintains the overall characteristics of target groups. Initially, the K-means algorithm is employed to distinguish between islands and oceans. Subsequently, a superpixel segmentation algorithm is used to aggregate island groups and simplify the generated boundaries. Finally, texture synthesis and transfer are applied based on the original image to produce the aggregated island images. Evaluation metrics demonstrate that this method can generate multi-scale aggregated images of islands, effectively eliminate redundant information, and produce smooth boundaries.","Renzhu Li,Yilang Shen,Wanyue Dai",Remote Sensing,2024
10.7494/geom.2023.17.6.77,,,Digital Cartographic Generalization – Study of Its Thresholds and Stages in Example of Cartographic Line,"Digital generalization of spatial data has been the goal of the research in many research centers around the world. This article presents the evolution of cartographic generalization, drawing the reader’s attention to the change of its nature from analog to digital. Despite the passage of time and developing technologies, scientists have unfortunately yet to develop a uniform automatic generalization algorithm. One of the factors that hinder this process is the high complexity and complication of the whole process. The article is an attempt to answer this problem and addresses the issue of digital cartographic generalization by creating a proposal of thresholds and stages of cartographic generalization depending on the ratios of the numbers of points of generalized objects. The publication attempts to examine the possibility of applying an objective criterion of drawing recognition by examining digital generalization algorithms and setting its thresholds. The practical aim of the publication is to present generalization thresholds on the example of Chrobak’s algorithm. The proposal to make the selection of generalization thresholds dependent on the percentage share of points is a solution that is as simple to use as it is to implement. The method of defining intervals based on the three-sigma rule is a solution that guarantees that the obtained results will be characteristic of the probability density function of the normal distribution, which will define individual intervals most objectively.",Szczepan Budkowski,Geomatics and Environmental Engineering,2023
10.1080/13658816.2024.2369535,39318700,,Reasoning cartographic knowledge in deep learning-based map generalization with explainable AI,"Abstract Cartographic map generalization involves complex rules, and a full automation has still not been achieved, despite many efforts over the past few decades. Pioneering studies show that some map generalization tasks can be partially automated by deep neural networks (DNNs). However, DNNs are still used as black-box models in previous studies. We argue that integrating explainable AI (XAI) into a DL-based map generalization process can give more insights to develop and refine the DNNs by understanding what cartographic knowledge exactly is learned. Following an XAI framework for an empirical case study, visual analytics and quantitative experiments were applied to explain the importance of input features regarding the prediction of a pre-trained ResU-Net model. This experimental case study finds that the XAI-based visualization results can easily be interpreted by human experts. With the proposed XAI workflow, we further find that the DNN pays more attention to the building boundaries than the interior parts of the buildings. We thus suggest that boundary intersection over union is a better evaluation metric than commonly used intersection over union in qualifying raster-based map generalization results. Overall, this study shows the necessity and feasibility of integrating XAI as part of future DL-based map generalization development frameworks.","Cheng Fu,Zhiyong Zhou,Yanan Xin,Robert Weibel",International Journal of Geographical Information Science,2024

This text explores the concept of automated cartographic generalization, highlighting its benefits and limitations, as well as the capabilities of computer technologies and specific software in the map-making process. Cartographic generalization creates certain accents and helps to show qualitatively new information on the map. Map compilation is the production of the original map, which involves creating a mathematical framework, incorporating content derived from cartographic materials with appropriate generalization, and finalizing the cartographic representation. The initial map compiler refers to the original map developed through this compilation process, on which the content elements are applied in accordance with the requirements of the editorial documents.","Natalia Minashkina,Albina Valieva,Aziza Ibraimova,Marhamat Rakhimbabayeva,Zulfiya Islamova",BIO Web of Conferences,2025

Several agent levels are considered, for example, individual agents, such as a building, and agents representing a group of agents, such as an urban block composed of the surrounding roads and contained buildings. Several multi-agent models were proposed to automate the orchestration of map generalization processes. Existing multi-agent generalization models have different approaches to manage the relations between agent levels. In this paper, we unify existing models, adapting a multi-level simulation model, to simplify interactions between agents in different levels. We propose the DIOGEN model, in which the principle of interactions between agents of different levels is adapted to constraint-driven cartographic generalization.

Considering the lack of quantitative criteria for the selection of elements in cartographic generalization, this study divided the hotspot areas of passengers into parts at three levels, gave them different weights, and then classified the elements from the different hotspots. On this basis, a method was proposed to quantify the priority of elements selection. Subsequently, the quantitative priority of different cartographic elements was summarized based on this method. In cartographic generalization, the method can be preferred to select the significant elements and discard those that are relatively non-significant.","Zhiling Long,Z.

So, it is the critical step to select suitable cartographic generalization algorithm which can perfectly fulfill the scale-transformation task. This problem is also a main obstacle in the way of automatic spatial data updating. Through deeply studying the flows of multi-scale spatial data updating process, an intelligent cartographic generalization algorithm selecting mode is proposed. Firstly cartographic generalization algorithm base, knowledge base and case base is built in this mode. Secondly, based on the step of resolving the cartographic generalization process into segments, a self-adaption cartographic generalization algorithm selecting architecture is constructed. Thirdly, an intelligent cartographic generalization algorithm selecting and using flow is established and put into effect. Overall, this mode provides a new idea to solve the automatic problem of multi-scale spatial data updating.","Junkui Xu,Junkui Xu,Dong Liu,Dong Li,Longfei Cui,Longfei Cui,Xing Zhang,Xing Zhang",GSKI,2017
10.3390/ijgi8060258,,,Learning Cartographic Building Generalization with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Cartographic generalization is a problem, which poses interesting challenges to automation. Whereas plenty of algorithms have been developed for the different sub-problems of generalization (e.g., simplification, displacement, aggregation), there are still cases, which are not generalized adequately or in a satisfactory way. The main problem is the interplay between different operators. In those cases the human operator is the benchmark, who is able to design an aesthetic and correct representation of the physical reality. Deep learning methods have shown tremendous success for interpretation problems for which algorithmic methods have deficits. A prominent example is the classification and interpretation of images, where deep learning approaches outperform traditional computer vision methods. In both domains-computer vision and cartography-humans are able to produce good solutions. A prerequisite for the application of deep learning is the availability of many representative training examples for the situation to be learned. As this is given in cartography (there are many existing map series), the idea in this paper is to employ deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for cartographic generalizations tasks, especially for the task of building generalization. Three network architectures, namely U-net, residual U-net and generative adversarial network (GAN), are evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively in this paper. They are compared based on their performance on this task at target map scales 1:10,000, 1:15,000 and 1:25,000, respectively. The results indicate that deep learning models can successfully learn cartographic generalization operations in one single model in an implicit way. The residual U-net outperforms the others and achieved the best generalization performance.","Yilin Feng,Yu Feng,Frank Thiemann,Frank Thiemann,Monika Sester,Monika Sester",ISPRS international journal of geo-information,2019

,,,Cartographic Generalization in Digital Environment,"Throughout the world numerous efforts to automate generalization are in progress. The results are yet to be satisfactory. Ample reasoning can be given to justify the lack of success, the most important being that generalization is an ambiguous process, highly subjective which lacks definitive rules, guidelines or systematization. This paper deals with the problem of generalization of vector data bases through the analysis of recent developments and research in the field. These developments tend to establish a promising framework which, with subsequent refinements and the utilization of state-of-the-art computer technology, may lead to successful results. What is needed is what lacks: Definitive rules in structuring the digital image of the world and development of expert systems which will intelligently manipulate this image.","Lysandros Tsoulos,Lysandros Tsoulos",International Hydrographic Review,2015

10.1201/9781003062646-6,,,Development of computer-assisted generalization on the basis of cartographic model theory,"Models are tools of various disciplines. They are a prerequisite of communication in and between the disciplines. A model is made up by purpose-oriented classification and reduction of the original. Every modelling process is primarily a generalization process. Since the 60s, cartographic model theory has developed on the basis of information theory, communication theory and semiology. Cartographic model theory has its roots in the fundamental human concept of mapping, i.e. the activity of every human being to secure their existence by defining their location in space and the accessibility of the spatial environment. Cartographic model theory describes the communication process related to geoinformation using three types of models of the environment: primary models provided by the disciplines involved, primary models provided by the disciplines involved, and tertiary models resulting from the thought processes of the map users (cognitive maps).","Dietmar Grünreich,Dietmar Grünreich",,2020

There are two ways by which web supported cartographic generalization can be accomplished (Foerster 2010):  1. Limited control of data representation (selection of layers and symbolization)  2. Complete control of the generalization process (usage of all generalization procedures with selection of specific parameters)  The first option is for users that are amateurs in cartographic generalization, and it enables them to have limited control over the shaping of map content. The second option is intended to be used by experts in cartographic generalization which would support development of automated systems for cartographic generalization.","Kristina Jezdić,Kristina Jezdić,Dražen Tutić,Dražen Tutić",Cartography and Geoinformation,2013

10.3846/enviro.2017.169,,,AUTOMATIC GENERALIZATION OF CARTOGRAPHIC DATA FOR MULTI-SCALE MAPS REPRESENTATIONS,"The multi-scale base map compiled from the official 1:10 000 framework data is served as the background in the national geoportal map browser. High expectations of the users of this map – both up-to-datedness and comfort of use – are pressing to search for more efficient methods to generate it preserving highest cartographic quality. There are two ways towards that: (a) automated generalization of the georeference base dataset into smaller scale datasets that are then used as sources for the multi-scale web map and (b) automated cartographic generalization of the single source dataset into multi-scale map layers (used in Lithuanian geoportal). As it is commonly believed that generation of Web map layers from separately generalised data sources is more appropriate, the authors performed a research in order to compare the two methods in terms of precision of representations, efficiency of update and communicative quality of the resulting maps. Some procedures that allow for improvement of visualization quality when the second method is used are discussed in the paper. The main conclusion drawn from the research is that a multi-scale map generated by means of cartographic generalization can for many applications successfully replace multi-scale map generated from separately generalized data sources.

,,,The New Definition of Cartographic Generalization Based on Conditioned Transformation,"Cartographic generalization must be needed in compilation from map A of larger scale to map B of smaller scale.Thus,there must exists transformation h:A→B in the cartographic generalization.As cartographic generalization types,the selection,exaggeration,etc.are essentially transformations between point set under some binding conditions,and different binding conditions correspond to different types of cartographic generalizations.According to this thinking,the authors have examined the mathematical definition of eleven cartographic generalization types including selection,exaggeration,etc.Because scale symbol,non-scale symbol and semi-scale symbol essentially belong to cartographic generalization,their mathematical definition may also be examined by the same way.","Tong Xin-hua,Tong Xinhua",Hydrographic Surveying and Charting,2013
